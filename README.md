## API Reference

### After starting server, visit `/api/docs`

## How to extend?
1.  Create a new route in `routes/index.js`
2.  If this route requires user to be logged in then add `authenticate` middleware
3.  If this route accesses a resource then make a method in the relevant controller to set the resource to the request object 
4.  If you want to give complete access to one role then 
    - Add 
        - `authRole(role)` where role is the key from `rbac/roles` eg: `ROLE.USER`
    - Else
        - add the middleware that checks for the specific permission defined in `rbac/permissions`
5.  Add the controller method

---

## Predefined roles
 - admin
 - moderator
 - user

---

## Creating roles
- Add the `key:value` of the role in the `ROLE` object at `rbac/roles`

---

## Creating permissions
1. In `rbac/permissions`, create a new method that takes minimum 2 parameters; `user` and the `resource`.
2. Write the permission logic.
3. Add this method in `module.exports`

---

## Creating a middleware to check for permissions
1. Create a method in the relevant controller that calls the permission you just created.
2. Write the checking logic 
3. Add this method in `module.exports`
